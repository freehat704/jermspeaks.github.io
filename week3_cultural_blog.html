			<h3><u>Reponse to the Fireside Chat</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 6th, 2014</h5>

			<p>The DBC experience seems very rooted in its core beliefs of engineering empathy, which I believe distinguishes it from many other programs. After watching the video, I found myself agreeing with Shereef about the kitchen and the restaurant metaphor because I flipped my own views on travel in about the same way.</p>

			<p>When I was growing up, my family went on a bunch of vacations and always bought tour package deals with the intent as one goes to a restaurant: you only go for the service and expect to get certain accomadations from it and nothing more. When I finally traveled on my own in my late teens, I discovered a world of exploration and wonder since I wasn't following a tour guide or sleeping in hotels. I met locals instead of meeting other tourists. I ate dinner at the marketplaces instead of at the continental restaurants. It was exhilarating and exciting, especially since I gave myself up to possibility rather than accomadations. Then, I wondered how come no one else travels this way.</p>

			<p>With my education background, I was a little of both the restaurant goer and the line cooks at the kitchen. For some classes, I just wanted the grade because I didn't care about the general ed subjects. For my college upper division courses, I felt cheated every time our lectures didn't go on for hours on a subject that mattered to me. For college project classes, I felt like the full reign and open subjects allowed me to thrive and really take control of what I was learning. But it was all abrupt and I wanted the aspects of learning without the aspects of taking classes that would only amount to less content than I intended. It probably also helped that I spent a considerable amount of my free time in a machine shop because that was also my playground.</p>

			<p>That's what I want from DBC, a playground of tools and a good chunk of time just messing around with it all to make my projects the way I want them to. The big difference between these two is the feedback time. Physical objects, or hardware in general, has a longer cycle time in product development and manufacturing. With programming, especially with proper version control, you can iterate at a much faster pace.<p>

			<p>DBC embodies the culture of how to make yourself a whole person rather than pumping out degrees, as colleges do. I was reading a while back about stoics and how some of them used to intentionally put themselves in unconfortable situations so that when the time comes to face a similar situation, they can deal with it a lot easier. One of the things in the video that struck a cord with me is how we are allowed to be a beginner. I'm an avid reader of zen, not so good at practicing, and what Shunryu Suzuki says about beginner's mind embodies the point Shereef was making with only knowing so much, and having the attitude to try to learn more. Suzuki says that a beginner's mind plays around with meditation and tries new things to reach that point where you don't think anymore, that you've been removed from yourself. A master's mind finds themselves following the same path they've used before, and can become arrogrant with trying to remove themselves during meditation.<p>

			<p>I'm hoping in putting all of my effort in engaging myself in this culture. I don't care if someone else thinks this as the rotten Koolaid because I'll be able to take the feedback a lot better and counter with that person with better responses, hopefully without emotions tied to it. It's really important in the long run anyways because we'll always be faced with similar situations where we don't understand something and need someone to explain it to us or have the ability to figure it out for ourselves. My expectations haven't changed about dbc. In fact, they are more heigtened and aware that this atmosphere really is what I want it to be, and more. It makes me incredibly excited. </p>

<!-- Notes from the fireside chat:
	Kitchen vs. Restaurant (mindsets)
		Kitchen is where we are all in this together. We're making the stew together. You are in creative mode. 
		Restaurant is consumer mindset, you look at it as a package (the service of what I'm getting, entitlement)

	The story
	Friend, no college degree, worked for 23andme, pays attention to details, losing interest in job (hit ceiling), is dev but doesn't know it, bet to learn RoR, couldn't do it with online resources, bet 8 weeks he could do it, and Shereef opened it up to everyone, interviewed people with traits of engineering empathy, at start they didn't know what they're doing, whatever happened was up to them (in it together).

	The experiment
	This is as awesome as you make it. See The kitchen mindset. "I can really do this." The true transformation.

	Teaching:
	It seems like a commodity. We want the opposite, to really take control of our learning instead of being spoonfed. 

	The two fears (sometimes we have both)
	1. Imposter syndrome (I'm not good enough)
	2. Mediocre syndrome (I'm too good, everyone else will be weighing me down)
	The reality: most of us are around the same range (0.01% of the journey of web dev)
		If you want to go far and fast, go together

	How to make the most out of prep

	QUESTIONS!

	What is your impression of DBC? 

	How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? 

	Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? 

	Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? 

	Does it make you nervous?
