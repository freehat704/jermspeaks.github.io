<!-- Notes from the fireside chat:
	Kitchen vs. Restaurant (mindsets)
		Kitchen is where we are all in this together. We're making the stew together. You are in creative mode. 
		Restaurant is consumer mindset, you look at it as a package (the service of what I'm getting, entitlement)

	The story
	Friend, no college degree, worked for 23andme, pays attention to details, losing interest in job (hit ceiling), is dev but doesn't know it, bet to learn RoR, couldn't do it with online resources, bet 8 weeks he could do it, and Shereef opened it up to everyone, interviewed people with traits of engineering empathy, at start they didn't know what they're doing, whatever happened was up to them (in it together).

	The experiment
	This is as awesome as you make it. See The kitchen mindset. "I can really do this." The true transformation.

	Teaching:
	It seems like a commodity. We want the opposite, to really take control of our learning instead of being spoonfed. 

	The two fears (sometimes we have both)
	1. Imposter syndrome (I'm not good enough)
	2. Mediocre syndrome (I'm too good, everyone else will be weighing me down)
	The reality: most of us are around the same range (0.01% of the journey of web dev)
		If you want to go far and fast, go together

	How to make the most out of prep

	QUESTIONS!
	What's your take on the DBC experience? 

	What is your impression of DBC? 

	How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? 

	Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? 

	Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? 

	Does it make you nervous?
