			<h3><u>Calm Down and Pass the Catharsis</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: June 6th, 2014</h5>

			<p>At the beginning of the prep unit, we wrote about <a href="http://jermspeaks.github.io/week1_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">affirming our values</a> by exploring what values align with us. Here is a recap of these values:</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accountability</li>
					<li>Activism</li>
					<li>Ambition</li>
					<li>Close relationships</li>
					<li>Community</li>
					<li>Creativity</li>
					<li>Health</li>
					<li>Helping other people</li>
					<li>Honesty</li>
					<li>Inspiration</li>
					<li>Music</li>
					<li>Quality</li>
					<li>Responsibility</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>My values I chose were because I built them up from a sense of community within an organization, from work to home to friends. This makes me rather extroverted because I rely on what other people think about me to find motivation in what I do. Within the last few years, I've found I also have an internal drive as well, and I've motivated myself to go through DBC to find something more about myself. I started reading "Search Inside Yourself" as recommended at the very beginning of our prep work, and it pairs well with the lifestyle I would rather have than to be anxiety prone, which is usually where I go in high-stress environments. To be empathetic is to know yourself. When I look back at this list, I still find myself resonating with it.</p>

			<p>Last week, we explored the concept of <a href="http://jermspeaks.github.io/week6_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">stereotype threat</a>. To recap, stereotype threat is when someone's performance is hindered because they feel the pressure of a cultural-common stereotype. If I am faced with stereotype threat, I now understand that I can recognize it and step back from the situation. I can let the emotions pass through me and then accept that it is occurring. Then I have the decision to act upon it or to let it go, which can be established a number of ways. Andy Hunt writes in "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning" to leverage your R-mode mind and then come back with your L-mode. To put it in laymen terms, you have to be able to see how let the processes of your conscious mind go, even for just a minute, and then come back to your consciousness. I find my emotions have subsided and I can think more properly in a situation. If this was happening to someone else, I would put them aside and go through the same exercise.</p>

			<p>If at anytime I'm feeling down at DBC, I'm going to take a break and breathe. It's a calming exercise I learned a long time ago to just let my calamity dissipate because I've got scatterbrain. Another coping mechanism is to take someone aside and have them question me. This is different from venting because venting involves a process of unleashing your emotions. In fact, the act of venting (also known as catharsis) <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/08/11/catharsis/" target="_blank">may cause this behavior to continue later</a>. Meditation has also been helping. If anyone is interested in zen but not buddhism, I would suggest the book "Zen Minds, Beginner Minds" for more of the core of the meditation practice.</p>
