			<h3><u>Don't Pay Attention To The Back Door</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 21st, 2014</h5>

			<p>About a year ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf9KjCKmDcU" target="_blank">this Youtube series</a> on cryptography explaining the progression of this subject over the last few centuries. The series is now on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. Last week, we worked on a substitution cipher, a fairly simple concept involving the shift of the alphabet by a specified number. The image below give an example of this.</p>

			<p>When I was a kid living in Berkeley, I used to pick up my parent's subscription to the SF Chronicle and go straight to the comics. Underneath the comics was the cryptogram puzzle.* The Chronicle's version of this game was to permutate the letters so each letter was a different letter. This is another form of the substitution ciphers. I noticed that there were patterns that started to emerge after doing a dozen or so of these. A few letters were always more noticable than others. For example, if the first word in the sentence started with a three letters, it was almost always "The". That would mean I would easily attain three letters, and I would start filled out the rest of the puzzle with these three letters. After staring at the puzzle for a few minutes other words and letters that were frequent started appearing as well. I used the frequency of letters that are used more than others I learned from watching one too many episodes of wheel of fortune (and playing a few games of scrabble) to think of what frequent letters on the cryptogram might be.</p>

			<p id="small-font">*Beside the cryptogram was the crossword puzzle. I really did not have a knack for words.<p>

			<p>As it turns out, the substitution cipher falls apart with the frequency of letters used in the alphabet ('R', 'S', 'T', 'L', 'N', 'E', as pointed out in the Wheel of Fortune video). Scrabble leverages this fact by giving weight to rarely used letters like 'j', 'q', 'x', and 'z'. The image below shows a frequency analysis of the English Alphabet.</p>

			<p>You may recall when we first set-up our Github accounts with our terminal, we had to create a private RSA key.</p>
