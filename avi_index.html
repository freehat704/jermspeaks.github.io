	    <h1>Avi Fox-Rosen Goes to Dev Bootcamp</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Introductions</h2>
	    
		    <p>Hi fellow bootcampers! I'm <strong>Avi Fox-Rosen</strong>. There are several things you may notice about me from the get-go. Perhaps I should present them in an orderly fashion, this being the interweb and such.</p>

			    <h3>fox-rosen describes himself thusly:</h3>
			    
				    <ul>
					  <li><em>Musician</em> - indie songwriter, guitarist + multi instrument person, producer.</li>
					  <li><em>Jewish</em> - oh my lordy. So Jewish. In the atheist, anti-authoritarian, smoked fish eating way.</li>
					  <li><em>Bald</em> - it's true. Been true since I was just 15 years old. EEK!</li>
					</ul>

				I TRIED LINKING TO THEM AS SAVED IMAGES WITHIN MY PROJECT'S IMAGE FOLDER -AND ALSO AS EXTERNAL LINKS (AS BELOW -THE FACEBOOK LINK). BUT NOTHING'S RENDERING. 
				NOT SURE WHY, AND GOOGLING SEEMS TO VERIFY THAT MY SYNTAX SHOULD WORK. CONFUSED! -->

		<h2>Why Dev Bootcamp Now Fox-Rosen?</h2>
			<h3>This seems like the appropriate opportunity for an ordered list.</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>I've been working as a freelance musician for 10 years, doing <em>A LOT</em> of music related things to make a living. Many bands, many shows, much teaching, recording, events, etc etc etc.  And it's getting harder to actually make a living doing what I love.</li>
					
					<li>I never would have thought I would become a developer in the past. But I was evaluating where to go and what to do next for employment.</br>Criteria For Evaluating What I Will Do Next:
						<ul>
							<li>creative work</li>
							<li>with creative people</li>
							<li>that will not be downsized in the foreseeable future</li>
						</ul> 
					</li>
					<li>And waddya know? That sounds like dev work. So I been studying, and learning. My girlfriend is an illustrator and developer, and more or less able to balance both. And ideally that's what I want. I have no delusions about being the best, or making a bazillion dollar with my <strong>genius startup idea.</strong> I have no genius startup idea. I just want security, in a creative field, that won't view my last 10 years of artsy fartsy ass kicking as a weakness. Also - I plan to continue artsy fartsy ass kicking (I like this term, and may continue to use it on the regular) whenever I can, with something else providing the bread, butter, and roof.</li>

				</ol>
