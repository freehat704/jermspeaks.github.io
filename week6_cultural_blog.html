			<h3><u>How To Be Your Ethnicity</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 26th, 2014</h5>

			<p>Stereotype threat is when there's a known stereotype that is known between two or more people, and someone is worried they could confirm the stereotype by performing poorly, creating a <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0060/prophecies.shtml" target="_blank">self-fulfilling prophecy</a>.It was first coined by researchers Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in their 1995 research paper. The first time I heard about stereotype threat was when I was reading Malcolm Gladwell's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-The-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669" target="_blank">Blink</a>". He refers to a study on the achievement gap between white and black students in the US may actually be affected by a stereotype threat. In this study, the researchers also took a bunch of white students, flew them to Japan, and had them take a test amongst Japanese peers. It turns out that the white students felt intimidated by the Japanese since they were now the minority.</p>

			<p>I found another part of his book even more compelling. Gladwell writes about a musician auditioning for a big orchestra. It was a blind audition so the judges were not biased in who was playing. The conductor was notorious for only admitting male musicians, so he was surprised when one of the musicians he chose was a woman. He was in disbelief because he thought women could never play an instrument better than men, so in all of his years in auditions, he was always biased towards men. This awakening of awareness may be one of the remedies in stereotype threats. I have a personally story about this as well. When I was in psychology class, my professor asked all of the students to close our eyes and imagine we were in a cave. Then we had to imagine we were looking at someone paint one of those cave paintings drawn thousands of years ago. The professor asked us to open our eyes and told students to raise their hands up if this painter was a male. I raised my arm up along with over 90% of the students. I was astonished that my mind had a default gender for my imaginary painters in my mind, and it made me aware that I generalize about men before women.</p>

			<p>Last week, our cultural blog assignment was to write about a problem facing tech, and I read an overwhelming amount of posts about the gender gap in the tech industry. Speaking as a man who actually considers himself a feminist, given that the definition of feminism is rights and equality for all women, I want to be able to work in a safe environment for all parties and not work at the boy's club. One of the biggest issues with the boy's club is there tends to be too much groupthink. This inhibits potential creativeness in problem solving. I've worked with some men who perpetuate these type of stereotypes, and have sadly been on both sides of the fence in support and defense of this behavior. It turns out if you have a voice and don't use it to speak up against misogyny or female stereotypes, it assumes you're in support of them. I've been recently practicing in telling people that this is wrong, even if it's not really going to win that person over.</p>

			<p>These negative stereotypes affect women of all ages. In grade school, there were boys who would pick on girls for not being smart at math. I'm ashamed to say I didn't do anything to stop it because I hated confrontation. In college, women were still being generalized. Conversations about women's intelligence were raised quite frequently, opting many to say they weren't fit to be engineers and they should all just stick with liberal arts. The worst joke was saying the Child Development major for a M-R-S degree (the "Mrs. Degree"). As an engineering student, there was a huge gap in gender in our majors. The Computer Science department was almost a joke since women comprised of less than 30%. It wasn't all gloomy though; there was SWE, Society of Women Engineers, supporting women in the field.</p>

			<p>I was in grade school when I was asked when I first knew I was Chinese. This was strange because I never had to put myself in a group before, separating myself from other people, due to my ethnicity. I started seeing what this talk about being African-American was all about. The teacher was trying to teach us about diversity as a part of the school's effort to push multicultural week during African-American History month. I grew up in a very diverse area where there was nearly no majority ethnicity, so I thought looking different than your peers was the norm. It hit home again when I read Baratunde Thurston's book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Black-Baratunde-Thurston/dp/0062003224">How To Be Black</a>" when he interviewed black people when they first realized they were black.</p>

			<p>When I went home, I thought about how much I've assimilated to the American culture. My mother wanted me to keep some Chinese roots at home since she is first generation Chinese-American. We spoke mainly in Cantonese. My father, who is third generation Chinese-American, didn't care about preserving the Chinese way of life and was fully assimilated into American culture. And with his nonchalance, he didn't care what ethnicity you were entering his home. One of the things I was never taught was how to deal with family members who were racist. We learned to be aware of it, so I took that awareness and tried teaching my immigrant family members, including my mother. Thankfully for my mom, she was a lot more understanding since she had to work with clients of different ethnic backgrounds. This was not so much the case of her family who has also recently immigrated to the US. A lot of times, my aunts and uncles would talk about a race war, and it was the us vs. them, and it meant I couldn't bring over a dark-skinned friend home if my father wasn't home. I've spoken to and witnessed multiple Chinese-American friends who went through similar experiences, except their parents would be first generation immigrants so they never allowed strangers of darker complexion home. Russell Peters, a Canadian comedian, explains in the clip below it's a common thread amongst Asian parents.</p>

			<p>It didn't really stop there. I would hear negative stereotypes being perpetuated by my relatives because they weren't aware they were not true. The worst case was my aunt was not educated about AIDS, she thought for the longest time it was a gay disease. But we all have these family members, and I've had to take all of what they've said with a grain of salt because if I don't, I start wondering these things. One of my ailments to a racist thought is to breathe and realize I'm not racist unless I act upon it. It's hard to break those sub-conscious thoughts of racism, but what I can change what I do have control over, like things I say.</p>

			<p>These racist remarks are only skin deep. Race relates to the appearance of a person, and not so much the cultural make-up and heritage of a person. One way I've combat my prejudices, so I don't perpetuate some stereotype threats, is that I get to know someone and I talk to them. It makes me forget that someone is white, black, Indian, Chinese, etc., and reminds me this person is human. Being human is that common thread we hold so dear.</p>

			<p>Going back to the original section on women, I think men pride themselves in being so different that men tend to portray women as an other, a group with their own distinct likes and dislikes, who are predisposed to doing some skills better or worse. As described in the orchestra audition story, this is not the case. I try to break down my brain's stereotypes in the boy's club by reminding myself of this story and similar stories. I talk to women and listen to their tales of joy and woe, because it makes them more human, not as a different group.</p>

			<p>I want to end with this sad tale of a man who never re-connected to art. It just shows how one negative, gender-based stereotype could change a boy's life.</p>

			<div class="quote">

				<p>After the group interview, he told me about his experiences growing up. He had been a passionate artist as a child, and he winced as he described how he was sure from an early age that he’d be happy if he could spend his life painting and drawing. He said that one day he was in the kitchen with his dad and uncle. His uncle pointed to a collection of his art that was plastered on the refrigerator and said jokingly to his father, “What? You’re raising a faggot artist now?”</p>

				<p>After that, he said, his father, who had always been neutral about his art, forbade him from taking classes. Even his mother, who had always been so proud of his talent, agreed that it was “a little too girly.” He told me that he’d drawn a picture of his house the day before all of this happened, and to that day it was the last thing he’d ever drawn. That night I wept for him and for all of us who never got to see his work. I think about him all of the time and hope he has reconnected with his art. I know it’s a tremendous loss for him, and I’m equally positive that the world is missing out.</p>
