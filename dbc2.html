					<p><strong>The Cuckoo's Calling, by Robert Galbraith</strong></p>
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Calling-Cormoran-Strike-Novel/dp/0316206857/"><img src="unit1_projects/images/book_cover.jpg" alt="The cuckoo's calling book cover"/></a>
					<br>
					<p>This is the latest novel by J.K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. This is a fiction crime novel set in modern day London following private detective Comoran Strike. The novel is about the murder of a young, rich model who dies in the middle of a winter night. At first, the press went head over heels that it was a suicide, but the private detective is brought to the case when the brother of the murder victim wants it re-investigated because he thinks it is a murder. This is supposed to be the first book in a series, and unlike Rowling's Harry Potter series, is a lot more adult. There's crime, violence, sex, and a whole lot more cussing than you'll hear from one of the students at Hogwarts. There's also themes of how the rich operate and enjoy their lives, and Rowling really shows how they are disgusting in their own right. Worth an airplane read, though it's nothing groundbreaking. The book kept me in my seat, making me think who the killer was.</p>
