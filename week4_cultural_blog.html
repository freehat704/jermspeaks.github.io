			<h3><u>Listening To Shame</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 14th, 2014</h5>

			<p><strong>Note to readers:</strong> the following story has a sentence that describes some adult content that may be too graphic to handle for non-mature audiences, so if you are under the age of consent reading this, stop reading now. If you're an adult who can not read about violence either, I also suggest you stop reading now.</p>

			<p>Author's note: The names of the people in this story have been changed to protect their identities.</p>

			<p>I remember back in the mid-90's watching a daytime talk show, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Montel_Williams_Show">The Montel Williams Show</a> with a specific episode highlighting 'forgive and forget.' All of the stories were with the host, a guest who did their family or friend wrong, and a person who was wronged by the guest. After the guest tells their story, Montel, the host, would ask the wronged party whether they can forgive and forget. Because this was daytime television and everything seemed scripted, the wronged party would forgive this person and forget the matter every happened.</p>

			<p>I was a kid back then (yes, I'm young), and I thought to myself that I would never wrong someone and would not regret any decision I would make. All of those people on the TV show are because they caused some sort of grief or anguish in the first place. If they just made the right decision in the first place, none of that would ever happen. Almost two decades later, I really want to slap that kid and say how very wrong I was. Decisions aren't always binary choices of a good choice and a bad choice. Decision making is very nuanced, and the consequences of your decisions can be a mix of good and bad.</p>

			<p>I always like to think it's easier to find the fault in other before finding the fault within ourselves. And I'm probably right. When thinking about conflict in ourselves, we cause ourself anguish, or a response shown on the wheel of shame. And whenever the body has to do work, like feel anguish, it tries its best to stop that source of pain. It's a path to least resistence.</p>

			<p>A few months ago, I got to hang out with my friend Grace. She's been applying for colleges prior months before and I wanted to celebrate her success in finishing her applications. However, on this particular meeting, she seemed distant and reluctant to talk to me. I was working long hours at the time and was mentally drained because I only got an average of 5 hours of sleep a night.</p>

			<p>We were driving to the supermarket and I tried to make conversation. I wanted to help and try to warm her up, but she wasn't having any of it. My frustration turned into verbal anger because she would only respond by saying, "you wouldn't understand."</p>

			<p>After I was through with a rebuttal, she yelled back at me with a tirade of swears. I knew I wasn't going to be able to keep this situation under control, so I stopped talking for the rest of the car ride. The silence was miserable.</p>

			<p>Grace didn't want to leave the car when we arrived at the supermarket. She just sat in the passenger seat and closed her eyes while putting her feet on the dash, which is something I'm not quite fond of. But because we just had this conflict, I shook it off. While I was in the supermarket, I realized how much of a fool I was to get angry and wanted to make amends. When I finished and got back to the car, Grace was sleeping. I drove her home, another silent car ride. She woke up and I tried to apologize to her about what had happened before. She looked at me and sighed, and got out of the car.</p>

			<p>Two weeks after this meeting, I get this text from Grace. It says that she was raped a few days before our brief encounter driving to the supermarket and she needed help. I talked with her on the phone and she was crying. I made her feel worse after our encounter at the supermarket because I accused her of not trying to reach back to someone who was trying to help. That one really hurt. Grace was depressed for a few weeks and her relationship had a falling out.</p>

			<p>Grace did get help a few days after we talked and is going through therapy. We also went to local police to report the incident even though the trail to find the rapist has gone cold (the rape involved a stranger outdoors).</p>

			<p>If I could go back, everything would've been handled differently. Put plainly, I lost my cool. I'm not going to talk about how Grace is wrong either, because I'm not the judge of that at all. I can only fault my own actions, and I know that yelling and getting angry at someone is never the right decision to make. Venting, as it turns out, is actually detrimental. It encourages you to vent again if you are faced with a similar experience.

			<p>From my own experiences, it's always best keep your cool. Don't vent on your negative emotions. Be aware you are angry, but try your best not to act on your impulse.</p>

			<p>If you hear of a loved one get raped, please do not hesitate to contact someone. I've listed an organization and two online support groups that are for this particular matter.</p>

			<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>

			<ul id="resources">
				<li><a href="http://www.rainn.org/">RAINN</a> - Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network</li>
				<li><a href="http://pandys.org/forums/">Pandora's Project</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.aftersilence.org/forum/">After Silence</a> - Online support groups if you have been raped</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Before I end this blog post, I want to share this video that has helped make me write about this experience.</p>

			<div class="blog-image">

			</div>

			<p>This blog post has helped me open up and be vulnerable to a lot of strangers. Why would I go and humiliate myself with such a shameful act? Because I've come to terms with it and because I can attest to one of the worst shame defenses, attacking others. It doesn't happen often, and when it does, it's downright disatrous. If that episode of Montel has taught me anything, it's that I need to be able to forgive myself and forgive others so I can forget it.</p>

			<p>This act of forgiveness is equivalent to a grieving period for the death of a loved one. When we skip the crucial emotional points, i.e. use one of our shame defenses (withdrawal, avoidance, attacking ourselves or attacking others), we numb ourselves of this experience and the next time a similar situation arises, we will repeat ourselves.</p>
