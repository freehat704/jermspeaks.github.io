			<h3><u>Thanks For the Feedback</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: June 11th, 2014</h5>

			<p>Last week, I read this book called "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114120-thanks-for-the-feedback" target="_blank">Thanks For The Feedback</a>", by Douglas Stone &amp; Shiela Heen. It is a follow-up to their other book, "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations" target="_blank">Difficult Conversations</a>" about the approach in talking to someone about an uncomforting situation. "Thanks For The Feedback" gives us the other side of that conversation, the person on the receiving end of the conversation. In this book, we are blocked by three things from letting the feedback get to us: truth, relationship, and identity triggers.</p>

			<p>A truth trigger is set off by the content of the feedback. We often think the feedback is lousy and incomplete, so it must not pertain to us. At this point, we pass off the feedback and don't find any merit in it. But lots of time there is merit in what is said, as well as not said. I found myself cherry-picking the feedback for only flaws, but I realized that there is a lot of merit in the positive feedback content. Skipping through this can oftentimes ruin my self-esteem because I only hear the bad news and don't attend to the good news, so I could easily pass off the feedback as irrelevant. But with the more recent feedback I've received, I'm looking at the feedback as a whole and trying to access the actionable part of it to really give myself some pointers on how to learn better for myself and everyone else.</p>

			<p>A relationship trigger is set off by the person providing the feedback. DBC has done something I've really enjoyed which is anonymous feedback. This partially eliminates the fingerpointing and actually hear what is being said. However, the anonymity is not foolproof and I've caught myself time and again to try to remember who the person giving the feedback is rather than listen to what they've had to say. Allowing the power of my mind to forget things after a week or two has allowed me to break this barrier down a bit more.</p>

			<p>An identity trigger is when you've become too overwhelmed to listen to the feedback, and it gets distorted. This emotions may come about by being thrown off-balance from your sense of who you are. I've blocked off a time slot in my schedule in my week to mentally prepare myself for the feedback. It's really important that I can stay level headed. I also keep a notepad handy so I can make notes to myself because I can then try to qualify what is being said and digest the feedback with clarity.</p>

			<p>I would suggest this book for everyone because it deals with almost any situation, even the ones we find mundane. For example, the book gives examples of conversations with family members whom you may hold high or low esteem. The book challenges you to have conversations that engage less with emotions and more with content, like having the unconventional question of going back to see what is being argued. I'm recognizing things like trackswitching (a conversation where two people are talking about two entirely different issues) and really trying to apply it to conversation.</p>

			<p>From our DBC prep work pairing sessions, the advice was very actionable because it was specific to the material we were learning. Those were easy to qualify. Others weren't, especially those involving emotion or specific contexts. For example, my pair and I agreed to work on the same challenge the next day because we didn't finish. After this session, I worked on the challenge a bit more to try to come up with a working solution. However, this was not good because my pair felt they were left out of the problem solving. I feel I should have been more empathetic, and because empathy is more of an abstraction, it's harder to qualify how I will change this later.</p>

			<p>Here are some improvements I am trying to make with my pairing sessions. Be direct about everything in the beginning rather than to waste someone's time later in the session, like how much time I have to do something, how I'm feeling, and how I communicate (i.e. learning styles). My personality is to be very focused and direct, which can be off-putting if my partner is more indirect. If I know this beforehand, it makes it easier to work with because there's fewer chances I'll be taking it personal if problems from this arise.</p>

			<p>Writing feedback was challenging because I'm not in the mindset to make my feedback actionable. I've been non-confronting for a good portion of my life, so it was hard to tell people what they could do next time, or learn more of. It took effort to really try to give the best feedback I could and not slump into something lazy, like "You did great. I really don't have much to say." Also, I found myself editing a lot of my feedback, trying to refactor, if you may, my words so I don't write many run-on sentences.</p>

			<p>One of the things that has been puzzling me in the feedback is trying to qualify this rating: [This student] was driving when we were pairing. The one definition I keep coming to is "compel (someone) to act in a particular way", and I can't process this correctly because it can mean in a positive or negative light. Seeing how we're trying to be more positive here, I'm compelled to go in that direction. The way I've been qualifying this is by thinking whether or not our pairing session has been moving along in a reasonable fashion (i.e. the flow of activity). This can be disrupted by distracting or going off-topic, although I initially took it as engagement. If you have a different definition of this word or this feedback, please share.</p>

			<p>I've changed the order a bit from our blog post exercise and will switch now to pairing. I took pairing as both a learning and a teaching exercise. I know there's usually a gap, even a tiny one, between the pair and me, so there's always a time for  clarification. This allows me to really work my brain in other ways to solidify learning if I'm teaching what something means, like using the Feynman Technique, or to explain with metaphor.</p>

			<div class="quote">
				<p>We use metaphors contantly: in fact, cognitive linguist George Lakoff... maintains taht we can't even think at all without the use of metaphor. Most humans aren't particularly good at dealing with the abstract: using a metaphor to relate some abstract notion to something concrete, something found in everyday life, makes it much easier for people to grasp.</p>

			<p>Also, I've been asking tons of questions while pairing. In past collaborations, I didn't articulate questions I had that I had issues with concepts, so I'll gloss over them and won't return for further comprehension. This all-or-nothing behavior was destructive in my past. Now, whenever I don't understand something, I'll stop the pair and ask. My pairs have been doing the same and I didn't sense much hesitation when they asked. I did, however, notice a lot of people were apologyizing for ignorance, which was discomforting because I've always associated apologies as amends to something that person did wrong. The phrase "ignorance is bliss" never wrang more true. But let's not be a hypocrite here, I spent a good chunk of my life apologizing for things that never needed an apology.</p>

			<p>I've had tons of fun working with pairs when we've accomplished a lot in so little time, or when we make comments like "this took me hours to understand and we've taken 15 minutes to get at the core of this concept." However, besides the apologies, the difficult thing for me was to stay driving for long periods of time. I've had a long pairing session for more than two hours, and I was feeling really tired. Pairing is an active engagement, so my mind switches to an active gear. I don't want to appear distracted or take breaks, which can be deterimental to the pair's work engine. But from my last job, I've realized we need those coping moments, and we all have them, and I'm thankful my pairs have been vocal about it because this is an area I'm lacking in. I'm rather frustrated when I can't bust out work for a lot of hours like when I work solo (which is also somewhat unhealthy), but I'm slowing coming around and changing my work ethic.</p>
