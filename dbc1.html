				<h3>Why Dev Bootcamp?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="why">
				<h4>
					<p><strong>A bit of background.</strong> I graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Cal Poly and have been working in the medical device field for a year and a half. Specifically, I've been in manufacturing for minimally invasive devices, or devices that do not involve large incisions, e.g. needles and catheters.</p>
				<br>
					<p>I am joining Dev Bootcamp because I really want to learn to code in an environment where I can get constant feedback of where I can continue to improve upon. I've tried coding on my own, but without proper guidence or feedback, it was difficult to keep that up.</p>
					<p class="code-history"><strong><u>Coding history</u></strong><p>
				<ul>
					<li>I created my first website when I was 12. It was with Geocities.</li>
					<li>I wrote a bunch of scripts to make tagging music a lot easier in my late teens</li>
					<li>I spent a considerable time in college creating models and simulations using technical computing languages. I also learned basic C language and how to use the command prompt for UNIX computers.</li>

				<h3>What is Jeremy's Philosophy?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="article">
				<h4><p><strong>Live simply, and work to live.</strong> The basic three tenets I live by is <em>socializing, creating, and learning</em>. With this basis, I am formulating and implementing many projects, including a novel, art piece, and a business.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I abide my my own rules, which is just stolen or "well-adapted" from our great thinkers. I value in my own personal philosophy the following things: critical thought, kindness and care to others, respect, finding meaningful purpose in what I do, as well as what I say, keeping myself balanced, and to expand my knowledge.</p></h4>
