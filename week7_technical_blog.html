			<h3><u>Programming Paradigms</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 30th, 2014</h5>
			
			<p id="intro">So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them.</p>

			<p>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm where the user inputs steps to get to a desired outcome. There's not much room to change the code without doing an overhaul if something changes with the desired outcome. Say you have historical data for weather patterns in your area and you wanted to output the total amount of annual rainfall. You program it and realize you changed your mind and want to map both an average daily rainfall and daily total temperature fluctuation. Well, now you've got to go back into the code and start deleting steps that you've already coded, and the code turns out much longer.</p>

			<p>Now say you know you want multiple outcome of your data, like annual rainfall, extrema points of highs and lows for each month, and high wind speeds of the month from a data set. Well, you can create functions for each of these things. This is the basis of functional programming. An interesting point is the data isn't mutable because the variables in the function are local, at least in Ruby. The problem with functional programming is if we introduce something new, like storm data that affects all functions, now we've got to update all of the parameters in our functions.</p>

			<p>Let's say we put all of the attributes of the data into a class and put all of our functions inside of the class. Now you've got the basis of object-oriented programming. If we introduce new data parameters, we can initialize it fairly easily without much fuss. We can use variables within different functions of a class, called methods in Ruby, by declaring instance variables. If we know what operations we want on our things or objects, we can evolve our code to add more things by adding new classes. The problem comes when we want to add functionality to our objects. Now we may need to update all of our classes with this new function.</p>

			<p><em>Which one is better?</em> The answer is 'it depends.' What are you trying to accomplish? If you're going for repetitive tasks like recursion, functional programming is better. There are languages that handle that type of computation, like Haskell and Erlang. For objects driven with behavior, object-oriented programming is better. This includes langages like Ruby and Python. The important lesson here is to understand what you're trying to build before programming.</p>

			<p>I've included a video to Sandi Metz talking about object-oriented design, OOD. This talk is about how code changes as you roll along your project.</p>
