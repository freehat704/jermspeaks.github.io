			<h3><u>Javascript the Great!</u></h3>

			<h5>Date: May 11th, 2014</h5>
			
			<p id="intro">Javascript is a programming language that interacts with the browser on the user end (this means you!). But it has no use unless you pair it with the other aspects of the web on the user end, HTML and CSS.</p>
			<div class="blog-image"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DEJOj4wKMOE/UNhxSB-QlQI/AAAAAAAAAEg/4J01k0tvaI0/s640/htmlcssjava.png" alt="Logos for HTML, CSS, and Javascript" /></div>

			<p>These three elements are backed by the W3C and works cross-browsers, including mobile browsers. Some features such as semantic web elements (new tags for HTML, under HTML5) are under review by the W3C for support, making it even easier to read. The same is happening with javascript with libraries like jQuery.</p>

			<p>HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the presentation. Javascript provides the functionality, or the behavior, of a website. It remains its own file on a webpage, and is accessed by your web broswer, meaning a broswer does not need to rely on this to load a webpage in case there are errors in the code. CSS is starting to include things like animation, but javascript does most of the heavy lifting. And when you want to interact with the code with Chrome's console, it's not as easy to debug.</p>

			<p>Say you want to create something like a dropdown menu. Well, with Javascript, you can do that. If you think about what actually happens, you click a menu button and then the menu appears below the button, allowing you to select different parts of the website. Javascript does this by taking the input of the user's access to this button and returns the menu.</p>

			<p>As humans, we want our environment to be interactive to us. Javascript allows that interactivity. Without this interaction, this webpage is nothing more than a really nice book with images and text. Next time you go on a webpage and you interact with it, you'll have more appreciation for what Javascript does for us.</p>
